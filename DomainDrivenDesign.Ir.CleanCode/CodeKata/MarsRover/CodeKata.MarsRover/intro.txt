1. You are given the initial starting point (0,0,N) of a rover.
2. 0.0 are X,Y co-ordinates on a grid of (10,10)
3. N is the direction it is facng (i.e. N,S,E,W)

4. L and R allow the rover the rotate left and right.
5. M allows the rover to move one point in the current direction.

6. The rover receives a char array of commands e.g. RMMLM and returns the 
	finishing point after the moves e.g. 2:1:N
7. The rover wrpas around if it reaches the end of the grid.
8. The grid may have obstacles If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle,
	the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacles e.g 0:2:2:N
